            <h1><strong>Getting a Dog</strong></h1>
            <p>If you've decided to get a dog, there are some things that need to be considered.</p>
            <h3><em>Are you sure you're ready?</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can You Commit? This is a very important decision and you will need to know if you are 100% ready to take care of your new friend.</li>
                <li>Will Your Pet Fit Your Lifestyle? Remember that you can't simply choose your new friend based on its cuteness. You'll also have to check if the breed you want will be able to live with your lifestyle and be healthy and happy.</li>
                <li>Will you be able to train your dog? It is very important to start early on training your dog.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><em>Things you will need to get started:</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collar and leash</li>
                <li>Dog bed</li>
                <li>Food and water bowls</li>

                <li>Not too expensive</li>
                <li>Adopting an older dog means he or she is probably already housebroken.</li>
