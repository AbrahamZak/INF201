            <h1><strong>Accessories</strong></h1>
            <p>There are many options for accessories for your new friend.</p>
            <h3><em>Collar and Leash</em></h3>
            <img class="accessoryPic" src="images/collarandlease.jpg" alt="Collar and Lease">
            <p>Your puppy will need a collar and lease from day one. A collar can be plain or fancy but holds important information, the dog license and identification tag with your name and phone number. A lease attaches to the collar and gives you control during walks and training.</p>
            <h3><em>Crates and Containment</em></h3>
            <img class="accessoryPic" src="images/cratesandcontainment.jpg" alt="Crates and Containment">
            <p>Crates and containment devices allow them to have a confined area where they can be monitored and housetrained. Make sure it is big enough!</p>
            <h3><em>Dog Bed</em></h3>

            <p>A comfy bed for your puppy is a must have. It will give your pup a place to relax and sleep.</p>

            <img class="accessoryPic" src="images/foodandtreats.jpg" alt="Food and Treats">
            <p>Food and treats are also needed to raise a healthy pup and treats are helpful for obedience training.</p>

            <img class="accessoryPic" src="images/groomingsupplies.jpg" alt="Grooming Supplies">
            <p>Grooming supplies are needed even with young pups as they need to be groomed and learn how to behave during the process. Regular washing, combing, and brushing is neccessary on the coat.</p>
            <h3><em>Identification</em></h3>
            <img class="accessoryPic" src="images/identification.jpg" alt="Identification">
            <p>Identification comes in two forms, an ID tag and a microchip. You can use either, but it is a good idea to use both.</p>
            <h3><em>Toys</em></h3>
            <img class="accessoryPic" src="images/toys.jpg" alt="Toys">
            <p>Toys provide comfort to dogs and come in all different forms such as chew toys that satisfy the need to gnaw (rubber toys, plush toys, stuffed animals), and comfort toys to have fun (balls, discs, rope/tug toys). </p>
