            <h1><strong>Food</strong></h1>
            <p>There are different potential diets for dogs that need to be considered.</p>
            <h3><em>What dogs eat</em></h3>
            <p>It is important to consult a vet when considering options of what to feed your dog. All dogs are individuals and diets can vary depending on breed and circumstance. For the most part, domestic dogs are mainly carnivores. It is acceptable to feed your dog a pure kibble diet, but you can also mix it up with cooked/raw meat, fish, vegetables, and rice. Here are some things to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose human-grade meat over pet meat as pet meat contain preservatives that can be bad for your dog's health.</li>
                <li>Practice food hygiene to not risk both you and your dog getting infections..</li>
                <li>Have a vet formulate a diet for your dog.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><em>How much food does your dog need?</em></h3>
            <p>Depending on size, breed, age, and amount of exercise, the amount of food your dog needs to consume can greatly vary. The key is to not over feed or under feed your dog. Also, remember to ensure that your dog is always hydrated by always having a water bowl full and available. The ideal body weight is when your dog's ribs can be felt through a slight fat cover. Age also is a factor when determining how much you should feed your dog.</p>
            <ul>

                        <li>Do not make huge diet changes at this time</li>
                        <li>Best food is high quality kibble for puppies</li>
                        <li>Optionally add cooked meats/vegetables but no raw diets</li>
                <li><strong>16+ weeks</strong></li>
                        <li>Introduce raw meaty bones gradually</li>
                        <li>When introducing new foods, keep an eye for any reactions</li>
                        <li>With age, gradually reduce number of feeds to twice a day</li>
                <li><strong>Adult dogs</strong></li>
                        <li>Should be fed once or twice a day</li>
                        <li>Ensure diet is complete and balanced</li>
                        <li>Choose large, raw, meaty bones, do not over feed</li>
